"As a car owner, I want to be able to input my car mileage and old maintenance data so that I can receive maintenance recommendations for my vehicle. 
By implementing a user-friendly interface with clear instructions, we can create a website that is easy to navigate and accessible.
This will enable us to efficiently gather and process the input data and provide accurate recommendations to our users.
By following agile and lean development principles, we can quickly and effectively create and iterate on our website, providing a responsive and personalized user experience, 
setting us up for user engagement, improved customer satisfaction, and sustainable growth for our business."
